    "\n",
    "`fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,6))`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where we intialize our plot, essentially setting up the space that we'll be working in. It creates a **Figure** object (`fig`) and an **Axes** object (`ax`). The Figure is the window in which we'll create our plot. In this case, we use the `figsize` argument to set the length and height to 8 and 6 inches, respectively. The Axes are the area around the figure, where the tick labels and titles are. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we plot the figure by taking the pandas Series and using the `plot()` method. We specify the number of bins at 20 (that is, how many rectangles we want in the plot), as well as a range for the x-axis. In this case, since there are some very high values that would stretch the graph out, we cut it off at 500."

    "### Making a Boxplot\n",
    "\n",
    "A boxplot is also used for numerical data, and can be used in a similar manner to histograms in showing the distribution of the data. Instead of putting everything into bins, though, a boxplot plots the median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile, along with outer limits and outliers. This makes for a simpler graph, and can be especially useful for comparing the distribution of multiple groups. However, unlike with histograms, you don't get any information about the number of modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for making a boxplot starts off very similar to that of making a histogram. We'll initialize the plot, then when using `plot()`, we'll use `kind=\"box\"` instead of `kind=\"hist\"`."
